  "intro": "I’m a UI/UX designer creating not just beautiful but effective designs that solve business problems, boost conversions, and scale easily. I work at the intersection of design, product, and frontend: I understand how products think and how frontend code works, while considering metrics, MVPs, and development constraints. I think like a user, calculate like a product manager, and structure like an engineer—turning business goals into clear, logical, and feasible interfaces.",

  "about-efficiency-title": "Efficiency",
  "about-efficiency-text": "Design that solves problems, not just looks good. User experience is optimized for conversion growth. Focus on speed: MVP, launch, tests—all to quickly understand what works.",

  "about-system-text": "Creating design systems that are easy to scale and maintain. I consider technical constraints, understand frontend, and work in a way that makes life easier for developers.",
  "about-strategy-title": "Strategy",
  "about-strategy-text": "I see the product as a whole: from idea and structure to final implementation. I contribute at all stages to ensure the result is deliberate and impactful, not random.",

  "stack-paragraph": "In my work, I combine analytics, interface thinking, and visual expression.\n\nA project starts with research: I study competitors, conduct interviews, and clarify what matters to users. Based on this, I build user flows and create the framework for the future interface.\n\nThe visual part is implemented through adaptive mockups and interactive prototypes in Figma. At this stage, I actively test hypotheses—sometimes even roughly, but with a clear goal: to understand where the interface works and where it doesn’t.\n\nIf needed, I add animations in After Effects, create promo videos, or do basic frontend with Tailwind/CSS to build an MVP. I work with Git and can streamline processes for teams or freelance projects.",

  "projects-paragraph": "Each of these projects is more than just a set of screens. They are thoughtful solutions based on user needs, clear logic, and visual expressiveness. I’ve gone through the entire process: from initial sketches and mistakes to the final pixel-perfect interface. Each project reflects my approach, style, and responsibility for the result.",

  "projects-downloadPage-paragraph": "The goal was to increase conversion and update an outdated page. I started from scratch: conducted brief interviews with marketing, identified user needs, gathered UX tasks, and created a mockup. After corridor tests and revisions, I built the final version using Bootstrap 4.",
  "projects-downloadPage-result": "A concise interface focused on action and clean visual presentation. The page became clearer and more effective for users.",

  "projects-registry-paragraph": "A section on the Varwin Education website where 3D, VR, and XR projects on various topics—from educational to entertainment—are collected. Previously, users had no place to share their projects; now they can submit them for publication, and others can download them directly. This simplified content access and reduced the workload on the sales team. In the future, self-uploading will be added.",
  "projects-registry-result": "The section simplified access to user projects, reduced manual work, and became the first step toward building a developer community within Varwin.",
