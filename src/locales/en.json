  "about-title": "UI/UX Designer",
  "about-paragraph": "Creating not just beautiful but effective designs that solve business problems, boost conversions, and scale easily. I work at the intersection of design, product, and frontend: I understand how products think and how frontend writes, factoring in metrics, MVP, and development constraints. I think like a user, calculate like a product, and structure like an engineer—turning business goals into clear, logical, and implementable interfaces.",

  "about-efficiency-title": "Efficiency",
  "about-efficiency-text": "I create designs that solve problems, not just look good. User experience is always aimed at increasing conversions. I focus on speed: MVP, launch, tests—to quickly understand what really works.",
  "about-system-title": "Systematic Approach",
  "about-system-text": "I build design systems that scale and maintain easily. I account for technical constraints, understand frontend, and ensure developers can comfortably work with my solutions.",
  "about-strategy-title": "Strategy",
  "about-strategy-text": "I see the product as a whole: from idea and structure to final implementation. I contribute at every stage to ensure the result is deliberate and impactful, not random.",

  "tools-paragraph": "In my work, I combine analytics, interface thinking, and visual expression.\n\nA project starts with research: I study competitors, conduct interviews, and clarify what matters to users. Based on this, I build user flows and create the framework for the future interface.\n\nThe visual part is implemented through adaptive layouts and interactive prototypes in Figma. At this stage, I actively test hypotheses—sometimes even roughly, but with a clear goal: to understand where the interface works and where it doesn’t.\n\nIf needed, I add animations in After Effects, edit promotional videos, or handle basic frontend with CSS/Tailwind/Bootstrap to build an MVP. I work with Git and can streamline processes for teams or freelance projects.",

  "projects-paragraph": "Each of these projects is not just a set of screens. They are thoughtful solutions based on user needs, clear logic, and visual expressiveness. I went through the entire process: from the first sketches and mistakes to the final pixel and a fully functioning interface. These are real commercial projects, each carrying my approach, my style, and my responsibility for the result.",

  "projects-downloadPage-paragraph": "The goal was to increase conversion and update an outdated page. I started from scratch: conducted short interviews with marketing, identified user needs, compiled UX tasks, and created a layout. After hallway tests and revisions, I coded the final version using Bootstrap 4.",

  "projects-registry-paragraph": "A section on the Varwin Education site where 3D, VR, and XR projects on various themes—from educational to entertainment—are collected. Previously, users had no place to share their projects; now they can submit them for publication, and others can download them directly. This simplified content access and reduced the workload on the sales team. In the future, self-upload functionality will be added.",
  "projects-registry-result": "The section simplified access to user projects, reduced manual work, and became the first step toward building a developer community within Varwin.",
