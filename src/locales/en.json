  "menu-about-description": "I create not just beautiful, but functional design that solves business challenges, boosts conversions, and scales easily. I work at the intersection of web design, product, and front-end, keeping in mind metrics, MVP, and development constraints. I look through the eyes of the user and structure like an engineer—turning business goals into clear, usable interfaces. I know front-end basics and can quickly build prototypes or landing pages. I also use video editing for presentations, promo materials, and UI animations to show design not only in static form, but also in motion.",
