  "me-paragraph": "Creating not just beautiful but effective design that solves business problems, boosts conversions, and scales easily. I work at the intersection of design, product, and frontend: I understand how products think and how frontend writes, consider metrics, MVP, and development constraints. I think like a user, calculate like a product, and structure like an engineer — turning business goals into clear, logical, and implementable interfaces.",

  "about-efficiency-title": "Efficiency",
  "about-efficiency-text": "Design that solves tasks, not just looks good. User experience is honed for conversion growth. Focus on speed: MVP, launch, tests — all to quickly understand what works.",

  "about-system-text": "Creating design systems that are easy to scale and maintain. I account for technical constraints, understand frontend, and work in a way that doesn’t cause pain for developers.",
  "about-strategy-title": "Strategy",
  "about-strategy-text": "I see the product holistically: from idea and structure to final implementation. I engage at all stages to ensure the result is not random but deliberate and strong.",

  "tools-paragraph": "In my work, I combine analytics, interface thinking, and visual expression.\n\nA project starts with research: I study competitors, conduct interviews, and clarify what’s important to users. Based on this, I build user flows and create a framework for the future interface.\n\nThe visual part is implemented through adaptive mockups and interactive prototypes in Figma. At this stage, I actively test hypotheses through user testing — sometimes even roughly, but with a clear goal: to understand where the interface works and where it doesn’t.\n\nIf needed, I add animation in After Effects, edit promo videos, or do basic frontend with CSS / Tailwind / Bootstrap to build an MVP. I work with Git and can streamline processes in a team or as a freelancer.",

  "projects-paragraph": "Each of these projects is not just a set of screens. They are thoughtful solutions based on user needs, clear logic, and visual expressiveness. I’ve gone through the entire journey: from initial sketches and mistakes to the final pixel and working interface. Each project reflects my approach, my style, and my responsibility for the result.",

I started from scratch: conducted brief interviews with marketing, identified user needs, gathered UX tasks, and created a mockup. After hallway tests and revisions, I built the final version using Bootstrap 4.",

  "projects-registry-paragraph": "A section on the Varwin Education website where 3D, VR, and XR projects on various topics — from educational to entertainment — are collected. Previously, users had no place to share their projects; now they can submit them for publication, and others can download them directly. This simplified content access and reduced the manual workload for the sales team. In the future, self-upload functionality will be added.",
