  "intro": "I’m a UI/UX designer who creates not just beautiful, but effective design that solves business problems, boosts conversions, and scales easily. I work at the intersection of design, product, and frontend: I understand how product managers think and how developers write code, taking metrics, MVP, and development constraints into account. I think like a user, calculate like a product manager, and structure like an engineer — turning business goals into clear, logical, and implementable interfaces.",

  "about-efficiency-title": "Efficiency",
  "about-efficiency-text": "Design that solves problems, not just looks nice. The user experience is optimized for conversion growth. Focused on speed: MVPs, launches, testing — all to quickly learn what actually works.",
  "about-system-title": "System Thinking",
  "about-system-text": "Creating design systems that are easy to scale and maintain. I consider technical constraints, understand frontend, and work in a way that doesn't make development painful.",
  "about-strategy-title": "Strategy",
  "about-strategy-text": "I see the product as a whole: from idea and structure to final implementation. I join at all stages to make sure the result is not random, but deliberate and strong.",

  "stack-paragraph": "In my work, I combine analytics, interface thinking and visual expression.\n\nThe project starts with research: I study competitors, conduct interviews, clarify what is important to the user. On the basis of this I build a user-flow and form the framework of the future interface.\n\nThe visual part is realized through adaptive layouts and interactive prototypes in Figma. At this stage I actively test hypotheses through testing - sometimes even on my knees, but with a specific purpose: to understand where the interface really works and where it doesn't.\n\nIf necessary, I connect animation in After Effects, promo video editing or basic layout with Tailwind / CSS to build MVP. I work through Git, I can set up the process in a team or freelancing.",

  "projects-paragraph": "Each of these projects is not just a set of screens. They are thoughtful solutions based on user needs, clear logic and visual expression. I went all the way from the first sketches and mistakes to the final pixel and working interface. In each project - my approach, my style and my responsibility for the result.",

  "projects-downloadPage-paragraph": "The goal of the project was to increase conversion rates and update an outdated page. I started from scratch: I conducted short interviews with marketing, identified user needs, collected UX tasks and made a mockup. After corridor tests and edits, I built the final version on Bootstrap 4.\n\nThe result is a concise interface with a focus on action and a clean visual presentation. The page became clearer and more efficient for the user.",
