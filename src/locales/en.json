  "intro": "I’m a UI/UX designer who creates not just beautiful, but effective design that solves business problems, boosts conversions, and scales easily. I work at the intersection of design, product, and frontend: I understand how product managers think and how developers write code, taking metrics, MVP, and development constraints into account. I think like a user, calculate like a product manager, and structure like an engineer — turning business goals into clear, logical, and implementable interfaces.",
